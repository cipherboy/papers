abstract="MD4 is a hash function developed by Rivest in 1990. It serves as the basis for most of the dedicated hash functions such as MD5, SHAx, RIPEMD, and HAVAL. In 1996, Dobbertin showed how to find collisions of MD4 with complexity equivalent to 220 MD4 hash computations. In this paper, we present a new attack on MD4 which can find a collision with probability 2−{\thinspace}2 to 2−{\thinspace}6, and the complexity of finding a collision doesn't exceed 28 MD4 hash operations. Built upon the collision search attack, we present a chosen-message pre-image attack on MD4 with complexity below 28. Furthermore, we show that for a weak message, we can find another message that produces the same hash value. The complexity is only a single MD4 computation, and a random message is a weak message with probability 2−{\thinspace}122.",

abstract="The ground-breaking results of Wang et al. have attracted a lot of attention to the collision resistance of hash functions. In their articles, Wang et al. give input differences, differential paths and the corresponding conditions that allow to find collisions with a high probability. However, Wang et al. do not explain how these paths were found. The common assumption is that they were found by hand with a great deal of intuition.",

abstract="This paper proposes several approaches to improve the collision attack on MD4 proposed by Wang et al. First, we propose a new local collision that is the best for the MD4 collision attack. Selection of a good message difference is the most important step in achieving effective collision attacks. This is the first paper to introduce an improvement to the message difference approach of Wang et al., where we propose a new local collision. Second, we propose a new algorithm for constructing differential paths. While similar algorithms have been proposed, they do not support the new local collision technique.Finally, we complete a collision attack, and show that the complexity is smaller than the previous best work.",
