    abstract="In this paper we report on a novel approach for uniform encoding of hash functions (but also other cryptographic functions) into propositional logic formulae, and reducing cryptanalysis problems to the satisfiability problem. The approach is general, elegant, and does not require any human expertise on the construction of a specific cryptographic function. By using this approach, we developed a technique for generating hard and satisfiable propositional formulae and hard and unsatisfiable propositional formulae. In addition, one can finely tune the hardness of generated formulae. This can be very important for different applications, including testing (complete or incomplete) sat solvers. The uniform logical analysis of cryptographic functions can be used for comparison between different functions and can expose weaknesses of some of them (as shown for md4 in comparison with md5).",

    abstract="Several standard cryptographic hash functions were broken in 2005. Some essential building blocks of these attacks lend themselves well to automation by encoding them as CNF formulas, which are within reach of modern SAT solvers. In this paper we demonstrate effectiveness of this approach. In particular, we are able to generate full collisions for MD4 and MD5 given only the differential path and applying a (minimally modified) off-the-shelf SAT solver. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a SAT-solver-aided cryptanalysis of a non-trivial cryptographic primitive. We expect SAT solvers to find new applications as a validation and testing tool of practicing cryptanalysts.",

In their articles, Wang et al. give input differences, differential paths and the corresponding conditions that allow to find collisions with a high probability. However, Wang et al. do not explain how these paths were found. The common assumption is that they were found by hand with a great deal of intuition.",
