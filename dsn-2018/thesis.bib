    abstract="In 1990 Rivest introduced the hash function MD4. Two years later RIPEMD, a European proposal, was designed as a stronger mode of MD4. In 1995 the author found an attack against two of three rounds of RIPEMD. As we show in the present note, the methods developed to attack RIPEMD can be modified and supplemented such that it is possible to break the full MD4, while previously only partial attacks were known. An implementation of our attack allows us to find collisions for MD4 in a few seconds on a PC. An example of a collision is given demonstrating that our attack is of practical relevance.",

In 1996, Dobbertin showed how to find collisions of MD4 with complexity equivalent to 220 MD4 hash computations. In this paper, we present a new attack on MD4 which can find a collision with probability 2−{\thinspace}2 to 2−{\thinspace}6, and the complexity of finding a collision doesn't exceed 28 MD4 hash operations. Built upon the collision search attack, we present a chosen-message pre-image attack on MD4 with complexity below 28. Furthermore, we show that for a weak message, we can find another message that produces the same hash value. The complexity is only a single MD4 computation, and a random message is a weak message with probability 2−{\thinspace}122.",

This is the first paper to introduce an improvement to the message difference approach of Wang et al., where we propose a new local collision. Second, we propose a new algorithm for constructing differential paths. While similar algorithms have been proposed, they do not support the new local collision technique.Finally, we complete a collision attack, and show that the complexity is smaller than the previous best work.",

Bitcoin depends on well-known cryptographic standards such as SHA-256. In this paper we revisit the cryptographic process which allows one to make money by producing new bitcoins. We reformulate this problem as a specific sort of Constrained Input Small Output (CISO) hashing problem and reduce the problem to a pure block cipher problem, cf. Fig. 1. We estimate the speed of this process and we show that the amortized cost of this process is less than it seems and it depends on a certain cryptographic constant which is estimated to be at most 1.89. These optimizations enable bitcoin miners to save countless millions of dollars per year in electricity bills.",

In this paper we demonstrate effectiveness of this approach. In particular, we are able to generate full collisions for MD4 and MD5 given only the differential path and applying a (minimally modified) off-the-shelf SAT solver. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a SAT-solver-aided cryptanalysis of a non-trivial cryptographic primitive.

This attack, with a complexity of 2116.9, generates a pseudo-preimage of MD5 and, with a complexity of 2123.4, generates a preimage of MD5. The memory complexity of the attack is 245 {\texttimes}11 words. Our attack is based on splice-and-cut and local-collision techniques that have been applied to step-reduced MD5 and other hash functions. We first generalize and improve these techniques so that they can be more efficiently applied to many hash functions whose message expansions are a permutation of message-word order in each round. We then apply these techniques to MD5 and optimize the attack by considering the details of MD5 structure.",

Using RIPEMD-160 as an example, our attack can find a second preimage for a 260 byte message in about 2106 work, rather than the previously expected 2160 work. We also provide slightly cheaper ways to find multicollisions than the method of Joux [Jou04]. Both of these results are based on expandable messages--patterns for producing messages of varying length, which all collide on the intermediate hash result immediately after processing the message. We provide an algorithm for finding expandable messages for any n-bit hash function built using the Damg{\aa}rd-Merkle construction, which requires only a small multiple of the work done to find a single collision in the hash function.",

The approach is general, elegant, and does not require any human expertise on the construction of a specific cryptographic function. By using this approach, we developed a technique for generating hard and satisfiable propositional formulae and hard and unsatisfiable propositional formulae. In addition, one can finely tune the hardness of generated formulae. This can be very important for different applications, including testing (complete or incomplete) sat solvers. The uniform logical analysis of cryptographic functions can be used for comparison between different functions and can expose weaknesses of some of them (as shown for md4 in comparison with md5).",
